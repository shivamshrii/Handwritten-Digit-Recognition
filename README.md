# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project is a Python-based implementation for recognizing handwritten digits using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a pre-trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The project leverages OpenCV for image processing, scikit-image for feature extraction, and joblib for loading the trained model.
